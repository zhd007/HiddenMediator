Each folder contains the R scripts for one of the simulation settings. In Setting 1, we vary <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pi_H">, the frequency that the hidden mediator is associated with the exposure SNPs; in Setting 2, we let two of the known mediators have negative effects on the outcome trait; in Setting 3, we decrease the sample size (number of individuals); in Setting 4, we consider cases where there are 1 and 10 known mediators of the outcome trait; in Setting 5, we consider four cases where some of the known mediators affect other known mediators; in Setting 6, we simulate two cases under the three-level SNP effect structure; in Setting 7, we simulate the case where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_H"> is equal to zero; in Setting 8, we vary the number of SNPs included in the model. For the base case and each of the seven settings, we consider a scenario where there are 70 SNPs associated with the outcome trait and another scenario where there are 500 SNPs associated with the outcome trait. For both scenarios, we let the hidden mediatorâ€™s effect size on the outcome trait, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_H">, be 0.02, 0.25, and 0.5 and perform 1000 independent simulations for each of the three values of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_H">. Also, for Settings 1-6, the "trend" sub-folder contains the simulations for 49 additional <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_H"> between 0.02 and 0.5 with a step size of 0.01, which show a behavior trend of our posterior distribution as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_H"> increases.



Under the folder of each setting, summary_plot.R generates Figure 3, S2-21, and the contents of Table S1, S2.
